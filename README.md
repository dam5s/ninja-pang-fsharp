# Ninja Pang

This is a small game I'm writing to learn **MonoGame**.
It's inspired by the classic arcade game **Super Pang** 

I have already written this game once before using **Haxe + Flixel**

## Building

This is written in **F#** using the **MonoGame** engine.
You will need both `.NET 5` and `.NET Core 3.1` to build it.

For now the MonoGame content pipeline still depends on `.NET Core 3.1`,
the rest of the build should work with just `.NET 5` though.

```
dotnet build
```

## Running Locally
```
dotnet run -p GameApp
```
